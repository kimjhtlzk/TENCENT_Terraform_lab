# Tencent Cloud Terraform Lab

> Real-world Tencent Cloud infrastructure code, designed for direct use in production environments.  
> Primarily integrated with **GitLab CI/CD**, with some exceptions.

---

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform code for provisioning and managing Tencent Cloud infrastructure.  
All configurations are written at a production-ready level and can be applied directly to real-world projects.

> **Note from experience:**  
> Tencent Cloud Terraform support is still maturing compared to AWS or Azure.  
> Modules are not updated on a regular release cycle, so it's essential to always verify  
> whether new or updated modules have been released before implementation.  
> Managing Tencent Cloud with Terraform requires extra attention to provider versioning  
> and module availability — but it's absolutely doable with the right structure.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kimjhtlzk/TENCENT_Terraform_lab.git

# 2. Configure Tencent Cloud credentials
export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID="your_secret_id"
export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
export TENCENTCLOUD_REGION="ap-seoul"

# 3. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 4. Plan
terraform plan

# 5. Apply
terraform apply
```

## ⚠️ Important: Module Version Check

Tencent Cloud Terraform provider modules are **not updated on a regular basis**.  
Always verify the latest provider version before starting a new project:

```bash
# Check latest provider version
terraform providers

# Or visit:
# https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tencentcloudstack/tencentcloud/latest
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

This repository is primarily designed to work with **GitLab CI/CD**.  
All module code is managed centrally in GitLab for collaboration.

Pipeline stages:
- `validate` — Terraform format & validation check
- `plan` — Generate and review execution plan
- `apply` — Apply changes to target environment
