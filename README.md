# TENCENT_Terraform_lab

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This repository contains TENCENT Terraform code, which has been primarily integrated with GitLab (with some exceptions). 
The code is prepared at a level that can be directly applied to real-world projects. Give it a try!

✨This repository has the following this strutnucture ✨

> I have set up a structure where all code modules are managed in GitLab by default, as collaboration is important. Tencent modules are not updated on a regular basis, so we always need to check whether any new modules have been released. 
(It seems we will need to put significant effort into managing Tencent with Terraform..)
